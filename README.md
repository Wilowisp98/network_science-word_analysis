# Network Science Project

## Project 
The main goals behind this project were to discover if, by analyzing a word adjacency network, we can:
1. Find a model which would generate a network similar to the word adjacency network
1. Identify which author wrote a specific text from it's word adjacency network
1. Identify which language a certain text has been written in (limited to english and portuguese)

## Conclusions
Due to the small dataset used in this project, the results obtained do not have any statistical relevance, but can be used as a starting point.
